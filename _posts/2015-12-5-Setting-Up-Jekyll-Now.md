title: Setting up Jekyll for my blog....
---

This is my first blog entry - I've decided to start documenting my projects - Primarily as a train of thought / reference for future use, but also in case someone finds it useful to review my way of working through problems / designs...

So - Challenge number one - Choose a blogging system... Jekyll on github was recommended by a friend, and as soon as I read that Jekyll is designed to allow you to blog like a hacker, I was sold... I'm going for the easy option for now - I've forked the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), and set up my github account to point at this project...

Looks pretty sweet - The idea of blogging using vim, git, and tmux is very appealing...

Gonna try to keep the blogs little and often so I keep doing them...

Cheers,

Jeremy
